# Security

When I became an IT Manager I was not well versed in the security side of things but I had to sink or swim as it was my duty to protect the company externally and internally. Having been in the IT field for over a decade I wasn’t completely ignorant of the duties that lay before me but the details were lacking. This was a sink-or-swim moment, especially in terms of compliance. 

Submerging myself into the details of cyber security I fell in love with the philosophical order-vs-chaos dichotomy: there are those who create chaos and there are those who restore order. That’s neat and harkens back to one of the reasons I started programming at age 12: to do bad things in AOL. Flash forward many years I found that passion again when trying to protect my company.

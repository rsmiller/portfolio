# Malwarebytes Input

When looking to implement an EDR solution at my company I reviewed Crowd Strike, Bitdefender, Malwarebytes, and Microsoft Defender. However, due to politics Microsoft was out, Crowd Strike seemed like overkill plus my coworker didn’t like the interface. Bitdefender was fine but the Malwarebytes interface was intuitive plus everyone at the company had heard of Malwarebytes so I settled on that plus a 35% discount of the pricing helped. 

Since the rollout of Malwarebytes, I have been providing them with some features I’d like to see. One of them is listed here. To simplify a few steps I requested that when a piece of malware was identified I wanted to see the hashes and have a link that would send me to VirusTotal. That is what was enacted in late September 2023. The images here are my contribution to Malwarebytes.

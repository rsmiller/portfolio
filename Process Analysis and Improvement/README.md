# Ryan Miller Process Analysis Examples

I went to school to be a systems analyst so interviewing people, documenting process, and coming up with solutions is something I enjoyed doing. I later studied and received my certificate Entry Certificate in Business Analysis from IIBA. Here are a few examples.

## Tag Room
I identified that a single individual created 95% of the tags for chain and wire rope while being placed next to an open-air restroom. I advocated creating a building inside one of the warehouses with an additional backup tagging machine. It was approved and the building was built shortly after, and me a help desk employee ran the cabling for the room network rack.

## Inspection Process
I was asked to identify and optimize the internal inspections process for several reasons 1) there was too much back-and-forth walking traffic between the inspections stations and the sales people 2) the turnaround to complete the inspections steamily were talking too long from a management perspective and 3) we didnâ€™t know what or how often we were inspection items or why some items needed to be created instead of repaired. This diagram illustrates, in blue, the additional steps in data collecting and performing the finalized inspection process. The mobile application was developed in .NET MAUI.
